# Day 02: Terraform Provider

Terraform provider is a bridge between your terraform and the cloud provider like AWS, Azure and GCP. When we ask about creating a cloud resource, what we normally do, go to cloud console and create the resources manually which is actually a calling their APIs.

When you run terraform command on the terraform configuration files the provider creates an interface between your terraform and target api/cloud provider.

Which means the terraform translate your code into the code that cloud provider like AWS, Azure, GCP understands.

### Provider vs Terraform Core Version
- **Terraform Core**: The main Terraform binary that parses configuration and manages state
- **Provider Version**: Individual plugins that communicate with specific APIs (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.)
- They have independent versioning and release cycles

### Why Version Matters
- **Compatibility**: Ensure provider works with your Terraform version
- **Stability**: Pin to specific versions to avoid breaking changes
- **Features**: New provider versions add support for new AWS services
- **Bug Fixes**: Updates often include important security and bug fixes
- **Reproducibility**: Same versions ensure consistent behavior across environments

### Version Constraints
Use version constraints to specify acceptable provider versions:

- `= 1.2.3` - Exact version
- `>= 1.2` - Greater than or equal to
- `<= 1.2` - Less than or equal to
- `~> 1.2` - Pessimistic constraint (allow patch releases)
- `>= 1.2, < 2.0` - Range constraint

### Best Practices
1. Always specify provider versions
2. Use pessimistic constraints for stability
3. Test provider upgrades in development first
4. Document version requirements in your README
5. Use terraform providers lock command for consistency

## Configuration Examples

### Basic Provider Configuration
```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = ">= 5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```

### Multiple Provider Versions
```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
    random = {
      source  = "hashicorp/random"
      version = "~> 3.1"
    }
  }
}
```
